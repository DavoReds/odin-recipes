    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>2</b> pounds of large red beans.</li>
      <li><b>2</b> chicken broth cubes.</li>
      <li><b>1</b> liter of water.</li>
      <li><b>1</b> large onion head.</li>
      <li><b>1</b> pound of bacon.</li>
      <li><b>1</b> large carrot.</li>
      <li><b>2</b> garlic cloves.</li>
      <li><b>1</b> large tomato.</li>
      <li><b>2</b> green plantains.</li>
      <li>Salt.</li>
      <li>Cumin.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Before starting with the preparation, it is ideal to let the beans soak
        in water overnight, this will make them softer and easier to cook. It
        also helps to reduce gas. And don't forget to reserve the water for use
        the next day.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the beans in the pressure cooker with salt and covered completely
        with water, about 40 minutes. But if it is a traditional pot, they
        should be at least 3 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chop the rest of the ingredients, onion, garlic, carrot, tomato and 2
        green plantains. You can mix them or separately, it is up to you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the bacon into small pieces and fry separately with a little more
        garlic and oil, this will make it release more flavor before adding it.
        Then set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the beans that we put to cook at the beginning are soft, we proceed
        to join them with all the ingredients that we have cut and reserved.
        Stir and season with more salt if necessary, as well as the chicken
        broth cubes and cumin to taste. Let it cook for another 10 minutes and
        serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
