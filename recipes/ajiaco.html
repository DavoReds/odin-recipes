    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The name of the dish that identifies Colombian gastronomy in the world
      comes from an indigenous legend, in which the names of the native governor
      of the time, Cacique Aco, and his wife Aj, were joined. The compound name
      where the woman came first gave origin to what we know as Ajiaco.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ajiaco with chicken is the only native and native indigenous dish, and the
      most traditional of Colombian gastronomy, although it can be prepared in
      different ways. However, it has been influenced by European gastronomy
      (chicken, capers, avocado and cream), but it will always keep its unique
      flavor. Ajiaco identifies the Colombian on the planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its greatest boom and development took place in colonial times when the
      indigenous people of the Muisca tribe, who settled in the regions of
      Cundinamarca and Boyac√°, prepared a soup composed of potato, onion, corn
      and

      >. In the 19th century, ajiaco was only prepared on important occasions
      and at Christmas parties.
