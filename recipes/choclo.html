    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Arepas are called the native bread in Latin America, especially in
      Venezuela and Colombia. Originally, they were made with a roasted corn
      dough, however, given their leap to the European continent, other dairy
      products were added, such as milk, butter or cheese. Also, you should know
      that, currently, there are about 70 varieties of arepas, all of them with
      different cooking, ingredients, utensils and varied fillings. On this
      occasion, we show a Colombian corn arepa that is really delicious with its
      intense corn flavor and somewhat sweet taste.
